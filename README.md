# Clinic-Database
As an assignment I was told to make a clinic database. This database stores

- Patients & Doctors.
- Doctors service and Appointments.
- Shows if payments were made or are pending.

It has data inserted to the tables already to show you an example when executed.

=======================================================================
It shows you:

- Total revenue collected
- Revenue by doctor (in descending order)
- The most popular service (in descending order)
- Paid or unpaid balances by patients (in descending order)
- Doctor utilization (in descending order)
- Daily revenue report (ordered by day)
- Patients with the most appointments (in descending order)
- Cancelled appointments in summary (in descending order)
